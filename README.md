# Blaqbern Basic Dark syntax theme

### A minimal dark syntax theme for Atom

When I was trying to choose a syntax highlighting theme, I found that a lot of the available themes made my code look very busy. It seemed like just about every word was a different color; I found this rather distracting. So, I developed this syntax theme to implement what are, in my view, just the essential highlighting rules. I think this makes the code easier to read and it looks nicer, too.

Optimized for html, css (and less), javascript, json, go, and markdown.

You can also keep the minimal highlighting rules and just replace the colors in colors.less with your own dark palette.
